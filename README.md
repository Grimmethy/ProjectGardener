# ProjectGardener

### What is Project Gardener?

#### I intend for Gardener to be a live interface for live image monitoring and processing.
#### The goal is to create a unified location and content context for live image feeds.

#### My current goal as of 9/7/21 is to create a link between live camera feeds and their geospatial location of both the image origin itself and the images it records.

#### 9/8/21 I managed to tie a number of sensor inputs to arcgis map locations. I currently have to manually import accelerometer and gps coordinates into the function. It currently turns raw accelerometer data into a tilt representation.

#### I still need to figure out the compass heading and fine tune where the phone is in space relative to the map as it currently gets us in the ballpark with the gps coordinates.

#### 9/9/21 I opted to play around with some facial recognition software I found on github. It thinks I am both younger and far more hispanic and asian than I am.

#### 9/11/21 No work on Gardener per se. Worked on setup for DUI project.

#### 9/14/21 What, ultimately is my purpose?
#### I used to think that the role of governance was to create a minimum standard... This has proven folly and I truly believe will not be the case, therefore the responsibility falls onto me.
#### I believe that my purpose is to ensure that those under my care are healthy, fed and have shelter. I believe that it is my purpose to provide the baseline standard of living that I want to see in the world.

#### This then breaks into three distinct parts:
##### Shelter.
###### How do I ensure that those under my charge have a place of privacy and rest? A place to feel safe and secure?

##### Food.
###### How do I ensure that those under my charge have enough food to sustain themselves with a satisfactory nutritional intake?

##### Health.
###### Healthcare has long been a problem within the american system. How do I insure that those under my charge have satisfactory health services?

#### Gardener is a tool. A means with which to obtain, cultivate and maintain these standards.

#### 9/17/21 Let's now assume that I have a single charge, a single dependant. Myself.
#### How much food do I need per day? What nutrional intake is optimal?

#### I like this calculator https://www.howmany.wiki/vw/--1%7C3--cup--of--fresh-chopped-tomatoes--in--gram

#### 9/23/21 Took a bit of a break from random coding. Slipped into rimworld... I thought I'd take a crack at edge detection today. I've had a blog post about it open for well over a week and I need to get this in a notebook before I close it.
