# ProjectGardener

### What is Project Gardener?

#### I intend for Gardener to be a live interface for live image monitoring and processing.
#### The goal is to create a unified location and content context for live image feeds.

#### My current goal as of 9/7/21 is to create a link between live camera feeds and their geospatial location of both the image origin itself and the images it records.
